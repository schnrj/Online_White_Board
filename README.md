# Online Whiteboard

An interactive **Online Whiteboard** built with **React** that allows users to draw, erase, and save their drawings. This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and is designed to be user-friendly, feature-rich, and easy to set up.

## Features
- **Draw and Erase:** Allows users to draw on a canvas and erase their drawings with different brush sizes and colors.
- **Brush Options:** Customize the drawing experience with various brush sizes and colors.
- **Save Drawings:** Save your drawings as images and download them to your device.
- **Undo and Redo:** Supports undo and redo actions to correct mistakes.
- **Responsive UI:** A mobile-friendly interface with a simple design, making it accessible on all devices.
- **Dark/Light Mode:** Switch between light and dark modes for a comfortable viewing experience.
- **Multi-User Support (Future Plan):** Allow multiple users to draw simultaneously in real-time.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** React.js, HTML5, CSS3
- **Backend (Future Plan):** Node.js, Express.js, WebSockets for real-time collaboration
- **Deployment:** Netlify or GitHub Pages

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser. The page will reload when you make changes, and any lint errors will show in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified, and the filenames include hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project and copy all configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project so you have full control over them. You can tweak the configuration as needed.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you're ready for it.

## Future Plans
- **Multi-User Collaboration:** Implement real-time collaboration using WebSockets so multiple users can draw and interact on the same board simultaneously.
- **Share Drawings:** Allow users to generate a unique link for their whiteboard and share it with others.
- **Cloud Saving:** Integrate cloud storage services for saving drawings in the cloud and retrieving them later.
- **Shape Drawing Tools:** Introduce tools for drawing shapes like circles, rectangles, and lines with customizable properties.
- **Text Tool:** Add the ability to add text to drawings with different fonts, sizes, and colors.
- **Export Options:** Provide multiple export options, including PDF and SVG formats.
